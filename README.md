# Context ðŸŒŠ

- SQL project with the the goal to provide insights for a surf school

How?
- Use a kaggle dataset - you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loureiro85/surfing)
  - Brazilian dataset based on online forms answered by surfers

 Goal:
 - Define the best board type according different parameters

# ERD Diagram ðŸŽ£

Dataset used has 44 columns and 164 rows. In order to become easier to analyse, the whole dataset was split into 5 tables (surfer, surfboard, performance, maneuver and wave)

# Conclusions â›µ

- Dataset doesnâ€™t provide much information for beginner surfers
- Most of the information come from advanced surfers
- Data needs to be cleaned

### Solutions for Surf School
 1. Focus on advanced surfers - provide different surfboards (shortboards) and advanced classes supported by data and film analysis.

 2. Focus on beginner surfers - create a survey and gather information next to surf schools

 3. Mix approach - focus both on advanced and beginner surfers.

### Future actions
- Going deep on the analysis of surfboards measures
- Create a survey to define which are the best wetsuits
- Create a survey to define prices for rentals and classes
