# Conclusions ⛵

- Dataset doesn’t provide much information for beginner surfers
- Most of the information come from advanced surfers
- Data needs to be cleaned

### Solutions for Surf School
1.- Focus on advanced surfers - provide different surfboards (shortboards) and advanced classes supported by data and film analysis.

2.- Focus on beginner surfers - create a survey and gather information next to surf schools

3.- Mix approach - focus both on advanced and beginner surfers.

### Future actions
- Going deep on the analysis of surfboards measures
- Create a survey to define which are the best wetsuits
- Create a survey to define prices for rentals and classes
